# Problem 1

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

The dataset *early_january_weather* describes hourly weather data from
nycflights13 for the month of January 2013. To summarize, the data has a
total of 358 observations, and 15 variables.

The variables in this dataset include the following variables:
**origin**, **year**, **month**, **day**, **hour**, **temperature (in
F)**, **dewp (dewpoint in F)**, **humidity**, **wind direction (in
mph)**, **wind speed (in mph)**, **wind gust**, **precipitation (in
inches)**, **pressure (in millibars)**, **visibility (in miles)**,
**time hour (date and hour of the recording)**.

The mean temperature is 39.5821229 with standard deviation of 7.058637,
and the mean of relative humidity is 65.4767039 with standard deviation
of 18.9453049

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid)) + geom_point()
```

Based on the figure, we perceived that as date time gets closer to the
mid January, the general trend of temperature increases. The relative
humidity seems to be mostly below 80, with several days where it
increases to 100, such as January 11 to 14.

# Problem 2

``` r
df = tibble(sample_points=rnorm(10, mean=0, sd=1),
            pos_indicator= sample_points>1,
            var_char= c("create", "some", "random", "char", "variable","for", "me", "please", "fangyi", "chen"),
            vec_factor = factor(c("low", "low", "high", "moderate", "moderate", "high", "high", "low", "low", "moderate"))
)

# Try taking the mean of the df columns
for (i in 1:ncol(df)) {
  print(mean(pull(df, i)))
}
```

    ## [1] -0.08863959
    ## [1] 0.2

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, i)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df, i)): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

For vector types such as numeric or logical, we can easily take the
mean. But for vector types such as factor or character, we can not take
the mean directly. For factor variable, we can use function `as.numeric`
which will return numeric codes corresponding to the factor level.

``` r
# Converted to the numeric types 
for (i in 1:ncol(df)) {
  converted_data = as.numeric(pull(df, i))
}
```

After we converted to all column variables to numeric, we can take the
mean for the original factor variables, as this function `as.numeric`
which will return numeric codes corresponding to the factor level,
allowing us to calculate the average. It does explain what happens in
the previous question where we tried to take the means for all column
variables. Essentially, the `mean` function can only handle the numeric
variables.
